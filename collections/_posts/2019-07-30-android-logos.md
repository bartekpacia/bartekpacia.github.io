The purpose of this post is to help anybody looking
for...you guessed, Android logos.

A few months ago I was creating a presentation at school about this 
fragmented-as-hell OS, and it took me **too much** time. There wasn't a place
in the internet where all these logos would be gathered in one place. Or just 
couldn't find it.
