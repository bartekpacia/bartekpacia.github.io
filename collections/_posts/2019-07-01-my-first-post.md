My situation now is that I have 2 webpages - this dummy Jekyll-powered blog
and a very simple personal website available at [bartekpacia.me](bartekpacia.me).

My first thought was to have leave it as it is (2 separate websites), one for the portfolio and second
for blogging, but eventually I decided one webpage would be be cleanier and _just better_
to suit my needs.

As I said before, I plan to blog a little so I picked Jekyll to help me with it.
I don't have much experience with _static site generators_, but after reading some docs
and watching a few YT tutorials I feel confident enough to alter Jekyll's default `minima`
theme to suit my needs.

So that's my first non-dummy blogpost looks like. Huh, it wasn't that bad.

See ya on the net.
