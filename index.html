    <h1>Android / mobile</h1>
    <p>I love Android for it for its openess and unlimited possibilities it gives.
      I've been developing Android apps for 4 years now.</p>
    <p>I'm also a big fan of Flutter and use it to deliver native, cross-platform apps.</p>

  <div class="index-container">
    <h1>Fullstack / everywhere</h1>
    <p>Even though my primary area of focus is the Android platform, I know a lot
      about many different technologies. JavaScript and TypeScript on frontend and backend,
      Python/Flask powered web apps, mobile and desktop games in Java/LibGDX and Unity.
